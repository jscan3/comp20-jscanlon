1. The purpose of this Git repository is to create a portofolio of all our assignments and labs 
throughout the duration of Web Programming. Additionally, it enables us to practice revision control. 

2. My favorite assignment was developing the client side of a ride sharing service (not uber).
It was a great opportunity to apply the google maps API, request/response protocol, and 
javascript event handler functions to render a legitimate and presentable website.
I felt really proud of this assignment because it challenged my knowledge of all 
the concepts we learned up to that point in the course. 

3. Entering this course, the only computer science experience I had was comp11. 
At first, I felt a little intimidated by some of the high caliber comp sci students
in the class, but have grown immensely from that first day and can confidently 
explain all the assignments I have completed in this course. The first lab 
was just testing our knowledge of developer tools, but it took me a very long 
time to complete it because I was not efficient with how I approached questions 
not specifically covered in class. After doing more labs and assignments, my 
critical thinking improved as well as my ability to glean from resouces like 
stack overflow and Ming's posted readings. I entered this course not even knowing
a rudimentary description of a server or client side script, but now I have the 
skills to build them. I learned several important topics in this course and in 
doing so feel like I have grown as a student and programmer. 

4. The most important thing I learned in this course is learning how to learn. 
There have been several instances where I either could not push to Github because
my master branch was ahead of my local changes, and I had to search through 
the git documentation to figure out how to solve this issue. Even after pulling
I still did not find success, but I realized it so much simpler to just 
delete the git repository and clone it. This allowed the master branch to be 
in sync with my local progress. Another example is trying to figue out how 
to render all the ride requests on an HTML page in assignment 3. Initially, 
I did not know how to approach this function without an HTML document. After 
looking back at my old assignments, I determined that I can just use the 
HTML tags in a string to actually render the information on a webpage at 
the given route. Therefore, the ability to problem solve and utilize resources 
is definitely the most valuable skill I took away from this class 

5. After just scratching the surface of web security, I am really interested in 
delving deeper in the programming methods to sanitize user input and protecting
data from external threats. Essentially, I would really like to learn how 
security impacts the implementation of creating something like a web server. 
I plan on taking comp 116 to explore this interest.
